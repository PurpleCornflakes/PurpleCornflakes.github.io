NUS library reminded me that this book is due today. This urged me to read the second half of if.

The first thing I learned from the book is:
*Once you can name something, you're conscious of it. You have power over it. You own it. You're in control.*

Now, let's name 4 basic principles below.

## the Essence of Design:
1. Our purpose is to attract people and make them read.
2. Keep things simple if not necessay,
- **Alignment** : each element has visual connection to the others
- **Repetition**: keep unity
2. but we all need **Contrast** to emphasize
3. and group related items as a visual unit -- **Proximity**.

### notice your eye flow
A bad design of business card and a good one:
<a name="tag1"><img src="/assets/img/bad_business_card.JPG" height="200"/></a>
<a name="tag1"><img src="/assets/img/good_business_card.JPG" height="200"/></a>
Attention is attracted to **Bold** things first, then the middle, then from up to down, left to right.

### let Picture do its work

### An example of Newsletter

## 6 groups of typefaces

<a name="tag1"><img src="/assets/img/typeface_how_contrast.JPG" height="200"/></a>

1. Fancy Perfume: too many similarities
2. Dogfood: good contrast
3. My Mother: too many similarities
4. Funny Farm: contrast needs to be strenthen
5. Let's Dance: good contrast

## A tip over <font color="red">Color</font>:

Our eyes are very attracted to **warm** colors(reds, oranges), so it takes very little red to attract attention. While **cool** colors(greens, blues) recede from our eyes, you need more of <font color="blue">a cool color to create an effective contrast</font>.

After learning all of this, I found my hand-written note page so poor. :no_mouth:
