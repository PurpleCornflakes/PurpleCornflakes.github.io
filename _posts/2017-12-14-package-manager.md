### Q1: What is indeed an AppStore?
It's a **Package Manager**(or, Application Manager), a software which
1. Find source of applications
2. Download and **install Libraries** the app depends on
3. Check updates regularly 

### Efficiency 
Without a Package Manager, you have to go to github and install/update applications & related libs by yourself. You can image how tedious and time-consuming it could be!

### Package Manager for different OS
`AppStore` has a GUI (Graphical User Interface). While
in *Linux* case, there's usually not.
- Ubuntu copied `apt-get` from Debian
- Fedora's `yum`
- Archlinux's `pacman`

### Q2: How about `pip`?
*Things are all designed in the same way.*

`pip` is a package manager for python.
Even *sublime* has its own package manager
### Q3: Anaconda vs pip?

Anaconda also manage packages, but more than that.
It also manages the whole distribution of e.g. Python3.5, i.e. all associated libs with python3.5, which makes Python2.7 and Python3.5's co-existence possible.
